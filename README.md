## Ad Approval

Ad Approval can be only done by AdMeta council, with a manual review of ad contents. You can ask for the approval of your ad in our Telegram and we will help you to approve your ads. After approval, the "Pending" status will become "Approved", and your ad will be published for everyone on AdMeta Network!

## Check Matched Ads and Claim Rewards
Ad matching happens during the idle and less busy time of AdMeta Blockchain, and it's done automatically without any inputs from either users or advertisers. Switch to the tab "Ad Display" to check if you have any matched ads now. 
If you have matched ads, you will see it like this:

After completing all required tasks, you are eligible to claim your reward. Click "Claim rewards" and you will be navigated back to your AdMeta WebApp page. And now your rewards have been claimed to your own wallet.
